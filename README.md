 **A minimalist, privacy-focused desktop application that enables voice input (speech to text) for redactors, IDE or AI assistants without sending your voice to the cloud. Uses the Whisper model locally for speech recognition. Written in Go, an optimized desktop application for Linux.**

## Features

- **Cross-platform support** for X11 and Wayland
- **Desktop Environment Support**: Native integration with GNOME, KDE, and other Linux DEs
- **Privacy-first**: no data sent to external servers
- **Portable**: available as AppImage and Flatpak
- **100% Offline, Key binding support, Automatic typing, Clipboard support, WebSocket API (optional, for external integrations), Visual notifications**
