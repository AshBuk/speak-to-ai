üìã **[Desktop Environment Support Guide](docs/Desktop_Environment_Support.md)** - help us test different desktop environments!

**For system tray integration on GNOME, [install the AppIndicator extension](docs/Desktop_Environment_Support.md#for-system-tray-on-gnome---to-have-full-featured-ux-with-menu) ‚Üë**
> KDE and other DEs have built-in system tray support out of the box

**For automatic typing on Wayland (GNOME and others) ‚Äî [set up ydotool](docs/Desktop_Environment_Support.md#direct-typing-on-wayland---ydotool-setup-recommended-user-unit) ‚Üë**
> X11 has native typing support with xdotool out of the box

> If automatic typing doesn't appear automatically, the app falls back to clipboard (Ctrl + V) mode
