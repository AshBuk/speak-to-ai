 **A minimalist, privacy-focused desktop application for offline speech-to-text.
  Converts voice input directly into any active window (editors, browsers, IDEs, AI assistants) 
  Uses the Whisper model locally for speech recognition. 
  Written in Go, an optimized desktop application for Linux.**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8448f73-57f2-46dc-98f9-e36f685a6587

## Features

- **Offline speech-to-text**
- **Voice typing or clipboard mode**
- **Portable**: AppImage package
- **Cross-platform support** for X11 and Wayland
- **Desktop Environment Support**: Native integration with GNOME, KDE, and other Linux DEs
- **Privacy-first**: desktop, no data sent to external servers
- **Support: multi-language, global hotkeys, automatic typing, system tray integration, visual notifications, WebSocket API (optional)**

## ‚ú¶ Installation

### AppImage

Download the latest AppImage from [Releases](https://github.com/AshBuk/speak-to-ai/releases):

```bash
# Download the file, then:
 chmod +x speak-to-ai-*.AppImage
 # Ensure user is in input group for hotkeys to work:
 sudo usermod -a -G input $USER
 # then logout/login or reboot
 # Open via GUI or with terminal command:
 ./speak-to-ai-*.AppImage  
```

### CLI Helper

The AppImage bundles the CLI so you can call it directly:

```bash
./speak-to-ai-*.AppImage start    # Begin recording (requires the daemon to be running)
./speak-to-ai-*.AppImage stop     # Stop and print the transcript to stdout
./speak-to-ai-*.AppImage status   # Check whether recording is active
```

Note: these CLI commands communicate with the running speak-to-ai daemon over a Unix socket ‚Äî the daemon must already be running for them to work. You can start the daemon simply by launching the AppImage once:

```bash
./speak-to-ai-*.AppImage
```

For source builds or packaging experiments, generate a standalone CLI binary:
```bash
make cli
./speak-to-ai-cli start
```

```bash
make cli
./speak-to-ai-cli start
```

The CLI communicates with an active `speak-to-ai` daemon through a secure Unix socket.  
Launch the main application once (AppImage or `make build`) and then trigger CLI commands from your window manager key bindings or scripts.  
Add the `--json` flag for machine-readable responses or `--socket` to point to a custom IPC socket path.

## Desktop Environment Compatibility

Help us test different desktop environments:

üìã **[Desktop Environment Support Guide](docs/Desktop_Environment_Support.md)**

**For system tray integration on GNOME, [install the AppIndicator extension](docs/Desktop_Environment_Support.md#for-system-tray-on-gnome---to-have-full-featured-ux-with-menu) ‚Üë**
> KDE and other DEs have built-in system tray support out of the box

**For automatic typing on Wayland (GNOME and others) ‚Äî [set up ydotool](docs/Desktop_Environment_Support.md#direct-typing-on-wayland---ydotool-setup-recommended-user-unit) ‚Üë**
> X11 has native typing support with xdotool out of the box

> If automatic typing doesn't appear automatically, the app falls back to clipboard (Ctrl + V) mode

## ‚ú¶ Project Status

**AppImage** [release](https://github.com/AshBuk/speak-to-ai/releases) - main distribution format. I'd appreciate feedback about your experience on your system!

**Flatpak** bundle is planned.
